Learn what, where, how, and why to use GraphQL, then learn practical advice on how to architect an application using the Apollo GraphQL library for React, Angular, or Vue.

You’ll first learn the basics: what is GraphQL, where should you use it, how to use it, and why to use it, then you'll learn more "advanced concepts" such as file placement, how to manage types, where to do mutations, queries, when to use apollo-link-state, how to utilize Apollo’s caching, how to effectively utilize an existing GraphQL backend, and lastly how to efficiently test a GraphQL application written in React.
