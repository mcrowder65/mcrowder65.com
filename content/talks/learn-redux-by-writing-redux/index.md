Attendees of this presentation will learn how to write their own global state management library (redux), which will then help them understand how redux works and how they can use it. 

We will write a third party middleware library (redux thunk), higher-order-components (HOC) that connect to the redux store, a way to subscribe to the redux store via componentDidMount, a way to unsubscribe from the redux store via componentWillUnmount, and ensuring that no unnecessary re-renders occur via shouldComponentUpdate, a React context provider, and a React context consumer (the HOC).
